High level plan:
  1. Classes and Instances
  2. Bindings
  3. Variables
  4. Method lookup / invocation

Reminders to self:
  remember to draw the Object Model as we go
  make sure they know its okay that they don't understand every piece of *code* (esp C code)
  the important part is to understand the concepts
  ie
    editor doesn't matter, it's a way to see the code
    shell doesn't matter, it's a way to invoke a program
    some unfamiliar syntax or method doesn't matter, as long as you can infer what it's doing
      (assert your inference to be sure)
  talk about stupid vs ignorant/incompetent
    stupid is a state of being (a characteristic)
    ignorant is a measure of knowledge (an acquirable quantity)
    incompetent is a measure of skill (an acquirable quantity)
    you *are not* stupid
    you *are* ignorant and incompetent when it comes to Ruby (not other things)
    this is a fact. Accept it.
    don't let your pride cause you to try to hide it (ie fear of speaking up and being wrong)
    that will prevent you from adequately addressing it
    which will keep you ignorant and incompetent
    IF you are willing to say "I don't understand", then you can address it
    and increase your knowledge and skill
    moving beyond ignorance and incompetence
  Same thing goes for me
    if I'm fucking up, then I'm fucking up
    this is a fact, regardless of whether anyone says it
    not saying it doesn't mean I'm not fucking up, it means it will be harder for me to realize and correct it
    so *tell me*
