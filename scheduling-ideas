break obj model 1 into 2 parts, so the whole thing takes 3 lessons altogether
start with bindings instead of classes and objects
  b/c I am pretty sure some students don't understand how method invocation works,
  and it is necessary to understand classes and instances
revisit object model once they've done some stuff in Rails, since they now have some experience with singleton classes and modules and inheritance
